## Techdegree Project 1 - My Personal Profile Page

**Skills Used:**

- HTML
- CSS

**Project Description:**

For this project I customized the existing code for a personal profile page website. I added my own graphics, which inculded a background header image that I purchased from Shutterstock and a professional personal profile image of myself. I customized the webiste by adding my own textual content. I added my own links to GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts to the existing social links for the social svg's. I added new pages for experience, interests and contact. I customized those pages with my own textual content, HTML and CSS. Within that customization I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adjusting the profile image border, transiton and transformation properties and I also added my own custom form on the contact page. I added an extra image on the interests page.

**Exceeds Expectations Requirements:**

Create at least one more page in addition to the Home and Experience pages, like a "Hobbies" or "Contact" page for example.

- You can write custom CSS for any new pages, just make sure you use style.css for all pages.

Edit the styling of the profile photoâ€™s CSS properties. Pick at least one of the following properties to change:

- border
- border-radius
- transition
- transformation

Add more photos and imagery to the page.

Add more text to the page such as a list of your hobbies.

**Grade Received:**
